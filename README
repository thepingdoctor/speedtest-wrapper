# Network Speed Test and ASN Lookup Script

This Python script performs a network speed test using the `speedtest` CLI and retrieves Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) for the source and destination IP addresses using the `dig` command with Cymru's ASN lookup service. The results, including download and upload speeds, ping latency, jitter, and ASNs, are printed in CSV format.

## Features

- **Dependency Check**: The script checks for the necessary dependencies (`dig` and `speedtest`) before running.
- **Speed Test**: Utilizes the `speedtest` CLI to measure download and upload speeds, along with ping latency and jitter.
- **ASN Lookup**: Resolves ASNs for the source and destination IP addresses using reverse DNS queries.
- **CSV Output**: Outputs the results in a CSV format for easy data handling and analysis.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `speedtest` CLI installed ([Speedtest CLI](https://www.speedtest.net/apps/cli))
- `dig` command available (commonly found in `dnsutils` package)

## Installation

1. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install dnsutils
   ```
3. Install the `speedtest` CLI:
   ```bash
   # For Debian-based systems
   sudo apt-get install speedtest-cli
   ```

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```bash
python script_name.py
```

The script will:

1. Check if `dig` and `speedtest` are installed.
2. Perform a speed test to measure download/upload speeds, ping latency, and jitter.
3. Retrieve ASNs for the source and destination IP addresses.
4. Output the results in CSV format to the terminal.

## Output

The output includes the following fields:

- Date and time of the speed test
- Source IP address
- Destination IP address
- Source ASN
- Destination ASN
- Download speed (Mbps)
- Upload speed (Mbps)
- Ping latency (ms)
- Ping jitter (ms)

## Error Handling

- If any dependencies are missing, the script will notify you and exit.
- The script provides detailed error messages if there are issues with running the speed test or retrieving ASNs.
